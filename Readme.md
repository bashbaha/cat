#Channel Adverarial Training for Cross-Channel Text-Independent Speaker Recognition -- Xin Fang et. al

###Advantages

1) No need for collections of different channels from a specific speaker. 
 
 Specifically, it needs labeled data under their repective channels: speakerA from channel A, speakerB from channel B is ok. Not ask for speakerA has channelA and channel B at the same time any more.

2) Referring to domain adaption, use Gradient Reversal Layer(GRL) to learn channel-invariant and speaker-discriminative speech representations via channel adversarial training.


3ï¼‰The paper can not only alleviating the channel mismatch problem, but also outperforms state-of-the-art speaker recognition methods.


###Model
1) Input: 500,64,1  filter-bank

2) Pad to short utterance, divide the long utterance into multiple short segments by employing a sliding window without overlap.

3) feature extractor: Generator (2-layer UniLSTMP)

4) speaker label predictor: D1

5) channel predictor: D2




###Cautions

1) gradient reversal layer may be worse when the model converges at the end.  [refer to: https://www.zhihu.com/question/266710153]
